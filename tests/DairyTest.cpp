The source character set of C source programs is contained within the 7-bit ASCII character set but is a superset of the
ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code Set. Trigraph sequences allow C programs to be written using only the ISO (International
Standards Organization) Invariant Code Set. Trigraphs are sequences of three characters (introduced by two consecutive
question marks) that the compiler replaces with their corresponding punctuation characters. You can use trigraphs in C
source files with a character set that does not contain convenient graphic representations for some punctuation
characters.

C++17 removes trigraphs from the language. Implementations may continue to support trigraphs as part of the
implementation-defined mapping from the physical source file to the basic source character set, though the standard
encourages implementations not to do so. Through C++14, trigraphs are supported as in C.

Visual C++ continues to support trigraph substitution, but it's disabled by default. For information on how to enable
trigraph substitution, see /Zc:trigraphs (Trigraphs Substitution).
